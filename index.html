                <div><p>particularly poorly explored, and yet it may well be the most important need and the
biggest stumbling block to a technical solution. The electronic consultation and
knowledge management tools, such as decision-support systems, could support each
other in various ways. Doctors could use the knowledge system for retrieving required
information before referring to the specialist. They could for example check what are the
necessary laboratory tests that should be done before referring. This would save
specialists’ time in electronic consultation as wouldn’t need to separately ask for those
tests. In addition that would be convenient for the patient.</p></div>

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p>Within the healthcare sector, different types of process can be identified with different
demands on the quality of information and knowledge required. The amount of reference
information needed to make a diagnosis differs from one specialization to the next in a
hospital. In some fields, the information required by a doctor consists mainly of basic
data, observations recorded in numbers and text, whereas in other fields an image or video
clip is considered crucial for drawing conclusions. While the significance of what is
known as tacit information is important in some fields, in the majority of cases it is explicit
information that is required; and it is in care chains relying heavily on explicit information
that the potential of information technology can be put to the best use.</p></div>
                <div><p>We examined the impacts on adoption of a new inter-organizational system in healthcare.
The consequences from using the Intranet-type referral system in the example case were,
first, that the number of patients who were asked to actually visit a specialist was reduced
to half thus reducing the burden on specialist resources. This was due to the replying
option in the system. According to the doctors involved, this happened in 75 percent of
the cases without any observable problems to fulfill the appropriate treatment. Secondly,
the rate of consultations was varied depending on referral urgency. The major time
reduction came to the least several cases. Thirdly, 5 out of 100 general practitioners’
patients normally treated also by specialists was doubled to 10. However, there were
differences between the benefits in different medical areas according to nature of
information related to education of different specialists. This should be considered more
carefully in the future, when new information systems will be planned and developed.</p></div>
                <div><p>Evidently in internal medicine, specialists make conclusions from pieces of information
of symptoms, medical histories and laboratory tests. The information used is explicit,
reasonably well structured and treatment is often medication. Intranet referral system
both increased the utilization of specialist consultation and decreased the need for
secondary care services by transferring information and knowledge to primary care. The
system allowed more patients to be treated at lower expense. Because all patients were
thoroughly examined beforehand, the numbers of repeat visits as well as direct costs
remained lower.</p></div>
                <div><p>In orthopedic surgery the situation appeared to be different, as the diagnostic process
is based more on tacit knowledge and the specialist frequently rely on direct observations. In orthopedics the specialists were not inclined to use e-mail consultations,</p></div>
                <div><p>therefore a videoconferencing system was installed allowing the specialists to study xray images and the patient located at health center while interacting with the general
practitioner. In half of the cases videoconferencing was found to work satisfactorily,
however, it did not reduce the number of patients that were eventually sent to the
hospital. The relatively cheap e-mail solution in internal medicine yielded a better return
on investment than the costly videoconferencing system in orthopedics. Consequently,
the natural logic of information and knowledge processing in various areas needs to be
examined carefully before investing in new information technology solutions.</p></div>
                <div><p>Although it has been said that it is possible to ease sharing of tacit knowledge by using
computer environment that is simulating real world (see Breite et al., 1999), it seems to
be expensive task in healthcare. To optimize relatively small resources it should be
invested more for developing sharing knowledge systems in those medical areas (like in
internal medicine) that are using explicit information. In those medical areas that are using
more like implicit information (like in surgery) development knowledge sharing systems
should be delayed until we have effective mass-products that are supporting multimedia
features. However, even then the development of those systems that are supporting
open communication between different specialists and more generally between different
professional groups should be encouraged. This would ease the change of working
culture into the direction of non-hierarchical knowledge sharing.</p></div>

                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p><em>By bringing people the right information in the right format at the right time and place,
state of the art clinical information systems with imbedded clinical knowledge can help
people make the right clinical decisions. This chapter provides an overview of the
efforts to develop systems capable of delivering such information at the point of care.
The first section focuses on “library-type” applications that enable a clinician to lookup information in an electronic document. The second section describes a myriad of
“real-time clinical decision support systems.” These systems generally deliver clinical
guidance at the point of care within the clinical information system (CIS). The third
section describes several “hybrid” systems, which combine aspects of real-time clinical
decision support systems with library-type information. Finally, section four provides
a brief look at various attempts to bring clinical knowledge, in the form of computable
guidelines, to the point of care.</em></p></div>
                <div><p><em></em></p></div>
                <div><p>“To be effective, (clinical decision support) tools need to be grounded in the
patient’s record, must use standard medical vocabularies, should have clear
semantics, must facilitate knowledge maintenance and sharing, and need to be sufficiently expressive to explicitly capture the design rational (process
and outcome intentions) of the guideline’s author, while leaving flexibility at
application time to the attending physician and their own preferred methods.”

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                 <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p>By bringing people the right information in the right format at the right time and place,
informatics helps people make the right clinical decisions. Cumulatively, these better
decisions improve health outcomes, such as quality, safety, and the cost-effectiveness
of care. This improvement has been a mantra of informatics at least since the landmark
article by Matheson and Cooper in 1982. This chapter provides an overview of the efforts
over the years to develop systems capable of delivering such information at the point
of care. Such an overview should help illustrate both the opportunities and challenges
that lie ahead as we struggle to develop the next generation of real-time clinical decision
support systems for use at the point of care.</p></div>
                <h2>Vision to Achieve</h2>
                 <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p>The ultimate goal is to provide patient-specific, evidence-based, clinical diagnostic and
therapeutic guidance to clinicians at the point of care; this guidance should be available
within the clinical information system (CIS) that defines their current workflow. In
addition, we must have the tools necessary to enable clinicians, without specialized
programming knowledge, to enter, review, and maintain all the clinical knowledge
required to generate this advice. Finally, we must have the ability to rapidly change the
clinical knowledge, test it, and make it available to clinicians without having to wait for
a regular CIS updating schedule.</p></div>
                <h2>Questions That Must Be Answered Prior to Creating
Such Systems</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p><b><em>What</em></b> information or knowledge is required to help the clinician make the right decision
to achieve the desired health outcome?</p></div>
                <div><p><b><em>Who</em></b> will be the information’s recipient (e.g., physician, nurse, pharmacist, or even a
specific individual such as the patient’s primary care physician)?</p></div>
                <div><p><b><em>When</em></b> in the patient care process is the intervention applied, for example, before, during
(which can be broken down into sub-activities such as order entry or progress note
creation) or after the patient encounter?</p></div>
                <div><p><b><em>How</em></b> is the intervention triggered and delivered? For example, does the system or the
clinician initiate it? How much patient-specific data (if any) is needed to trigger systeminitiated interventions? How much is the intervention output customized to the clinical
workflow stage, the clinician, and or the patient? For system-initiated interventions, how
can the threshold be set to minimize nuisance alerts? How intrusive should the information be (Krall, 2001)?</p></div>
                <div><p><b><em>Will</em></b> the clinicians find the information useful (Krall, 2002a, 2002b)? What can we do to
minimize the number of false positive alerts?</p></div>
                <div><p><b><em>Where</em></b> will the clinician be when receiving the intervention, for example, with the patient
at the bedside or in the office? What should happen if the information becomes available
at some future point when the clinician is no longer with the patient to whom the
information pertains?</p></div>
                
                <div><p><b><em>Which</em></b> medium will be used to convey the message, for example, e-mail inbox, wireless
and/or handheld device, pager, CIS/CPOE screen, or printed pre-visit encounter sheet?</p></div>
                <div><p><b><em>Is</em></b> there a demonstrable return on investment (ROI) that is due exclusively to the clinical
decision support intervention or feature?</p></div>

                <h2>Where Do We Stand?</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p>Numerous attempts have been made to bring various forms of clinical information to the
clinician at the point of care. One way to solve this problem is to develop computer
applications that stand alone, although often network accessible, and are available to the
clinician upon his/her request. Another way is to incorporate the clinical knowledge
directly into the clinical information system used by clinicians while giving care. Once
it is there, the CIS system can automatically prompt the clinician or the clinician can
request help. Recently, a third model for system development has been proposed that
enables the clinician to request help from an outside source. Often several patientspecific data items are included in the request. Using such a system, a clinician is still
completely in-charge of making the request for information and the information can be
automatically configured based on a sub-set of patient information (Cimino, 1996). In
addition, it is now possible to embed medication or procedure codes along with
instructions that tell the CIS how to handle this information that allows a clinician to place
an order directly into the patient’s electronic medical record from the externally available
information resource (Tang & Young, 2000).</p></div>
                <div><p>The following diagram (Figure 1) is an attempt to illustrate both the key types of
information or knowledge that investigators have focused on along with their mode of
interaction [i.e., directly to the clinician or through the clinical information system (CIS)].

that have been made to develop clinical knowledge management applications and to help
everyone understand how different clinical knowledge resources and applications are
both related in terms of what they are trying to accomplish and different in the resources
they utilize. Although this diagram is fairly complex, it is only a small, imperfect and
incomplete representation of the entire clinical decision support landscape.</p></div>
                <div><p>The following sections briefly review each of the projects or concepts. The first section
focuses on “library-type” applications that enable a clinician to look up information in
an electronic document. The second section describes a myriad of “real-time clinical
decision support systems”. These systems generally deliver clinical guidance to clinicians at the point of care within the CIS. The third section describes several “hybrid”
systems, which combine aspects of knowledge-based clinical decision support systems
with library-type information. Finally, section four looks at various attempts to bring
clinical knowledge in the form of computable guidelines to the point of care.</p></div>

                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                
                <div><p>Biomedical bibliographic databases contain on the order of millions of records, each
representing a unique scientific journal article that has been published. Each record
typically contains the title of the article, the authors, their affiliation(s), and the abstract
of the article. In addition, several metadata tags may have been applied by human indexers
to improve the likelihood that each document will be retrieved when and only when it is
relevant to the user’s query.</p></div>
                 <div><p>For the last 30 years, the National Library of Medicine has maintained the MedLine
database, the most common bibliographic database used in clinical medicine. During that
period, various attempts have been made to develop easy to use and reliable interfaces
to this vast resource including Grateful Med (Cahan, 1989) and COACH (Kingsland,
1993). Currently, PubMed is the most widely used of all these interfaces. PubMed relies
on a sophisticated free-text query processor to map freetext user queries to MeSH terms,
when appropriate, and returns a highly relevant set of documents.</p></div>
                 <div><p>In addition to PubMed, several commercial vendors have created proprietary interfaces
to the MedLine database in an attempt to improve either the recall or precision of the
user’s queries. For example, Ovid has developed an interesting MeSH mapper and query
expander that has gathered outstanding reviews from highly trained librarians. Knowledge Finder has developed a fuzzy mapping algorithm that has also generated some good
reviews. Unfortunately, none of these systems consistently enables clinicians to retrieve
more than half of all the relevant articles on any particular topic (Hersh, 1998). In addition
to these variations on a search interface, several projects have used automated differential diagnosis generators, such as DxPlain, as an interface to the bibliographic DBs.
Finally, the Science Citation Index uses the reference list at the end of every scientific
article published to generate linked lists of references. Such a scheme can also identify
particularly noteworthy articles since these articles are referenced many more times.
Interestingly, the Google search engine uses this same concept to generate its index of
relevant web sites. It does this by keeping track of the number and quality of referring
web sites rather than references at the end of the article (Brin, 1998).</p></div>
                <h2>Other Clinical Reference Materials</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                 <div><p>In addition to access to the bibliographic literature, clinicians could use other clinical
reference information. For example, various systems exist to provide clinicians with
access to the complete text and figures contained in textbooks (e.g., MD Consult) or
journals (e.g., Ovid) in electronic form. In addition, several commercial companies have
begun developing synthesized, evidence-based clinical summaries of the diagnosis and
treatment of common clinical conditions [e.g., Up-to-Date, CliniAnswers, DiseaseDex,
PDxMD (see http://www.informatics-review.com/KnowMan/Examples.html for other
examples)].</p></div>
                <h2>Real-Time Clinical<br>
Decision Support Systems</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                 <div><p>Real-time clinical decision support systems (RCDSS) are fundamentally different from
“library” applications in that they interact with the clinician through the CIS. Rather than
relying on the user to interpret the text and then make a decision, RCDSS combine the
patient’s clinical data with the clinical knowledge to help the clinician reach a decision.
At least six distinct methods can provide this type of RCDSS:</p></div>
                <div><ol style="text-align: justify">
                    <li>Medication formularies and drug-drug interaction checkers provide routine checks
of all orders entered into the EMR. They can recommend alternative medications
based on the formulary and check for potential drug-drug interactions automatically following entry of a medication order assuming they have access to the
patient’s list of current medications. FirstDataBank, Micromedex, and Multum are
examples of commercial providers of drug-drug interaction checking databases.</li>
                    <li>Automated rule-based reminders are used most commonly to remind clinicians to
perform routine health maintenance procedures. The Arden syntax is currently the
only “standard” means of encoding these rule-based systems (Arden, 2003). The
Institute for Medical Knowledge Interchange (IMKI), another recent entry into this
field (IMKI, 2003), recently scaled back their operations while they seek additional
funding and support.</li>
                    <li>Condition-specific order sets and charting templates help clinicians remember and
facilitate the entry of all related orders or answers to questions asked of a patient
with a particular condition. Zynx, a recently formed company, is developing these
ready-to-use, condition-specific order sets. In addition, most of the commercially
available CISs either offer ready-to-use order sets or provide tools to help clinicians
construct these order sets (Franklin, Sittig, Schmiz, Spurr, Thomas, O’Connell, &
Teich, 1998).</li>
                    <li> Integrated clinical guidelines allow a clinician to compare a specific patient’s
clinical data against a guideline and automatically receive a recommendation. The
most advanced example of this type of application is Enigma’s PREDICT application. In an early attempt to develop this sort of functionality, Epic Systems created
their “Active Guidelines” application. A major distinguishing feature between the
Active Guidelines (AG) effort and that of Enigma is that the AG user is still required
to search for, read, interpret, and then decide which portion of the large, text-based
guideline document applies to a specific patient and then select the appropriate
recommendation. Enigma’s PREDICT automatically does all of this work and simply
presents the clinician with the appropriate suggestions. Another recent entry into
this market space is Theradoc, a small company located in Salt Lake City, Utah
(www.theradoc.com).</li>
                    <li> Complex, physiologic models incorporate our best current understanding of human
physiology along with evidence-based results of randomized clinical trials to
generate patient- or population-specific predictions of future events. Archimedes,
a complex model of diabetes and the entire healthcare system, is currently configured to allow specially trained clinicians to access this resource (Schlessinger,
2002). Jonathan Brown, from Kaiser Permanente’s Center for Health Research in
Portland, has recently begun working on a method to automatically link therapeutic
suggestions generated by his Global Diabetes Model to a specific patient’s clinical
data from an EMR or clinical data warehouse (Brown, 2000).</li>
                    <li> Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have been developed to help clinicians complete their differential diagnosis list. To date these systems have not had widespread acceptance by clinicians, even though they have been shown to be at least
as good and often better than un-aided clinicians (Bankowitz, 1989; Berner, 1994)</li>
                    
                    </ol></div>
                 <div><p>DxPlain, QMR, and Weed’s Problem Knowledge Couplers (Weed, 1986) are the best
examples of these types of systems.</p></div>
                <h2>Hybrid Applications</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                 <div><p>In addition to each of these fairly straightforward attempts to link clinical knowledge to
the point of patient care, several companies have attempted to combine various clinical
knowledge resources and applications to generate even more useful applications.
MedWeaver (Detmer, 1997) was an early attempt to combine DxPlain, an AI-based
differential diagnosis (DDx) system with a bibliographic database. The DDx in conjunction with the Unified medical Language system (UMLS) act as an automatic query
expander and presents the user with information related to all the known items on the
patient’s differential diagnosis.</p></div>
                 <div><p>Geissbuhler and Miller (1998) developed WizOrder, a system to automatically generate
potential drug-drug interaction reminders when clinicians order medication through the
system. These reminders are based on the co-occurrence of clinical term frequencies1
 that
are a part of the UMLS’s Metathesaurus database. Rennels, Shortliffe, Stockdale, and
Miller (1987) developed Roundsman, a prototype system, to automatically extract
evidence-based recommendations from on-line structured journal articles.</p></div>
                 <div><p>Cimino (1996) developed the concept of the “InfoButton” which allows a clinician to
automatically generate queries to a variety of clinical information resources to answer
a set of generic concept-specific questions such as, “What’s the treatment for X?”, where
X can be any clinical condition. Recently, the HL-7 Clinical Decision Support Task Force
has begun efforts to develop a standard for such queries.</p></div>
                <h2>Computable Guidelines</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <h2>Current State of the Art</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p>Various research and commercial efforts are underway in an attempt to create systems
to achieve the vision outlined above. The distinguishing feature of computable guideline
systems is that they are more than a simple application of “if-then-else” rules to generate
alerts and reminders at the point-of-care. All of the systems described below are
attempting to go one step further with multi-step clinical algorithms at the point-of-care.
The more complex algorithms attempt to track a patient’s treatments and progress over
time, while the alerts and reminders serve only to look at what is best at each point in time.
Therefore, I did not include the efforts of the Institute for Medical Knowledge Interchange (IMKI) or the Arden group to create libraries of rules and systems to facilitate
their incorporation in various clinical information systems.</p></div>
                <div><p>The following sections overview several attempts and describe which parts of the vision
they either have or are currently focusing on. I also point out the strengths and
weaknesses of each approach.</p></div>
                <h2>Academic Research Efforts</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p><b>GLEE</b> is a system for execution of guidelines encoded in the Guideline Interchange
Format v3 (GLIF3) (Wang, 2002). GLEE provides an internal event-driven execution
model that can be hooked up with the clinical event monitor of a local clinical information
system environment. It was developed at Columbia University and is currently only a
research prototype. No tools exist for knowledge maintenance other than those proposed
by the GLIF3 organization.</p></div>
                <div><p><b>GLARE</b> (GuideLine Acquisition, Representation and Execution) is a domain-independent system for the acquisition, representation and execution of clinical guidelines
(Terenziani, 2001). GLARE provides expert physicians with an “intelligent” guideline
acquisition interface. The interface has different types of checks to provide a consistent
guideline: syntactic and semantic tests verify whether or not a guideline is well-formed.
GLARE technology has been successfully tested in different clinical domains (bladder
cancer, reflux esophagitis, and heart failure), at the Laboratorio di Informatica Clinica,
Azienda Ospedaliera S. Giovanni Battista, Torino, Italy. Currently, this application is not
available for use by people outside of the research team. See: www.openclinical.org/

                <h2>Commercial Vendors</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                <div><p><b>Therapy Edge</b> (http://www.therapyedge.com/) is a condition-specific, stand-alone, webbased, EMR with extensive clinical decision support for HIV patients. It is a stand-alone
tool, that is, it has no integration with the existing CIS; it is only for HIV patients; and
has no tools for knowledge based maintenance.</p></div>
                <div><p><b>PRODIGY</b> is a guideline-based decision support system in use by a large number of
General Practitioners in the United Kingdom (Purves, 1999). The evaluation of PRODIGY
3 is currently underway and Phase 4 is being planned. PRODIGY I and PRODIGY II were
implemented as extensions to proprietary UK electronic patient record systems. The
PRODIGY system includes a proprietary guideline model, which in PRODIGY II was used
to implement guidelines for the management of acute diseases. See: http://
www.prodigy.nhs.uk/ClinicalGuidance/ReleasedGuidance/GuidanceBrowser.asp for a

at regular intervals (three to four times per year). They do not even mention the possibility
of integrating their work with any commercially available EMR products. See: http://
www.tg.com.au/complete/tgc.htm for an online demonstration. This is just one of many
examples of stand-alone, proprietary format, internet-based, guideline presentation
systems. In my opinion, none of these are significantly better than what the USA’s
National Guideline Clearinghouse (www.guideline.gov) or the New Zealand Guidelines
Group (www.nzgg.org.nz) are doing by simply creating a large database of clinical
guidelines that are arranged by clinical condition.</p></div>
                <div><p><b>AREZZO</b> is a decision support technology (based on PROforma), for building and
running clinical applications. AREZZO applications are designed to provide patientspecific advice, guiding the user through data collection, clinical actions and decision
making. Applications can be quickly modeled and tested, using the AREZZO Composer,
and instantly deployed on the Internet. AREZZO is capable of supporting the development of multi-disciplinary care pathways (customized for local circumstances); its safetycritical and task-based features support the rigor needed for clinical protocols. Currently
the system is limited to supporting decisions on pain control in cancer, but this will be
expanded in the future to include pain control in much more general terms (for example,
arthritis, chronic pain, etc.) See: http://www.infermed.com/ds_arnocs.htm for more
information.</p></div>
                <h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
                <div style="width:100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
                
                <div><p>Library-type applications that provide users with easy access to the latest medical
knowledge in the form of journal articles or textbooks will not be going away in the near
future. Even with our increasing understanding of how to build intelligent computer
systems that can recognize the current patient context and suggest potentially relevant
clinical information resources, the users must still have a means of getting directly to the
knowledge resources so they can look up additional information. Therefore, work based
on the Medline Button, as described by Cimino (1996) must continue. In fact, an effort
is now underway within the HL-7 Clinical Decision Support Technical Committee to
develop a standard interface that will facilitate further development of these types of
applications.</p></div>
                <div><p>The use and utility of real-time clinical decision support systems (RCDSS) will continue
to grow exponentially. As more and more pressure is placed on clinicians to practice
evidenced-based medicine and do it as inexpensively as possible, these RCDSSs will
proliferate. A recent publication by the Health Information Management Systems
Society (HIMSS) entitled, the “Clinical Decision Support Implementers’ Workbook” is
now freely available on the internet (Osheroff, 2004). This workbook and others should</p></div>
                <div><p>lead to increased use of various clinical decision support systems. Although little work
is currently underway on the development of new hybrid systems, I believe that these
types of systems will soon reappear and provide users with significant additional
functionality that cannot be achieved using any other means.
Finally, as healthcare delivery systems choose and implement commercially available
clinical information systems, clinicians and researchers alike could gain valuable knowledge by beginning work on various clinical knowledge management projects with one
or more of the vendors or research groups listed above. At the present time, this field has
no clear-cut winner. In fact, no system is beyond the advanced research prototype stage.
As such, there will be considerable changes in whichever solution is ultimately successful. I believe it is in everyone’s best interest to be a part of the effort in defining and
experimenting with these types of systems. Only then will we truly understand what is
really useful and how we should proceed.</p></div>
